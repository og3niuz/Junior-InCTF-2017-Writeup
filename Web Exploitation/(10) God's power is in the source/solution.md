## Hint

>How can you view the **HTML** source when mouse right click is disabled in the browser ? May be you can use "**curl**" in linux ? Or even an "**inspect element**" in the browser itself ?

## Solution

Easy. There are three ways to do so:

* Use cURL `curl http://103.10.24.99/Web-10/`
* Use inspect element of the browser
* Directly see the source in the browser by pressing `Ctrl+U`

The flag is commented right there in the source.
