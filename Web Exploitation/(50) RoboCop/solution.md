>URL : http://103.10.24.99/Web-50/index.html

## Solution

Classic noob robots.txt challenge.

Go to http://103.10.24.99/Web-50/robots.txt and checking the file...

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /flag.html
```

Okay, the flag is at http://103.10.24.99/Web-50/flag.html

```
Seriously MAN, you are here, I didn't expect that!!!!!

Go, somewhere else!!! And find the flag!!!
```

:thinking:

The source revealed the flag's directory.

```html
<!DOCTYPE>
<html>
<body>
<p>Seriously MAN, you are here, I didn't expect that!!!!!</p>
<p>Go, somewhere else!!! And find the flag!!!</p>
<!--By Solving this you will get directory of the flag: 
	[chr(ord('fmcd[luX`lxn'[i])^i) for i in xrange(12)]-->
</body>
</html>
```

Executing that python statement gives the directory, which is `flag_is_here`. Going to the destination finally revealed the flag.
